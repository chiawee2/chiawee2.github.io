<h2>Services</h2>
	<p>Book an appointment for a discussion about how we can help your business in the following areas:</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Paid Social</h3>
		<p>What is it? Digital Marketing on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and other social media platforms is available to your business, no matter the size.

		<h4>Case Study: B2C example</h4>
		<p>An local automotive parallel importer's objectives for online advertising was clear, to bring leads for the showroom car sales team to convert into purchases. 
		Successful sales leads generation is measured by the number of customers and potential customers who eventually purchase a car as a result of the advertisements on social media (Facebook) in this case.
		With a budget of a mere ten dollars a day, after a period of 7 days, two cars (a car in Singapore has a price tag of at least ninety thousand dollars) were sold as a result of the campaign.
		Selection of audience target and timing of advertisements are important.  The ability to find "lookalike" audiences, remarketing to "website custom audiences" is available for all business, if your business sets it up correctly at the start of the campaign.</p>

	<h3>Paid Search</h3>
		<p>What is it? Customers turn to online sources to research on products and services before they purchase.  Be easily found on Google and other search engines through AdWords Advertising.

		<h4>Case Study: B2C example</h4>
		<p>A local beauty salon buying keywords on Google Adwords to find new customers who would come by for a trial service.
		In general, we have observed across industries that google search adwords tend to cost 2 to 3 times per click versus a facebook ad cost per click.
		That itself should not be a deterrent for google ad campaigns to increase visitors to your business' website because (potential) customers who search for keywords related to your business are searching to purchase or to collect information before purchase.
		The spend to be invested for google adwords could be calculated as a percentage of potential revenue for successful conversion after X clickthroughs.
		Timing of advertisements, ad copy (text in ad) testing and competitive analysis are some keys to success.</p>

	<h3>Go Omni-Channel</h3>
		<p>The push for retail businesses to go online is not new. With the options crowded with e-Marketplaces, how do businesses understand the drivers of costs and levers for profitabilty.
		<h4>Case Study: B2C example</h4>
		<p>A brick and mortar shoe shop embarks selling online via top-ranked e-marketplaces, selling on facebook and having a dedicated shop website.
		Successfully listed, promoted and sold shop products on Qoo10 (ebay equivalent in South East Asia) and Lazada (Alibaba owned marketplace).
		Created Facebook Business Page with Shop function.
		Created online shop for shoes with international sales delivery options.</p>

	<h3>Business Consulting</h3> 

		<p>Assistance on topics (non exhaustive):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Engaging existing customers to re-purchase with loyalty rewards and customer referral programs.</li>
			<li>Market Research: Find out what are your competitors doing, formulate and implement a response.</li>
			<li>Customer Contact Strategy:Communicating with your customers from prospects, onboarding through to repurchase, ensure you keep in touch with your customers using email marketing and other tools.
			Different customer engagement ways that exists with the prevalence of digital platforms.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Marketing basics do not change, the tools used for customer engagement and customer retention provides so many more options for businesses as a result of digital.</p>
		<p>The adage used to be that it costs 5 times more to get a new customer than it is to retain an existing one.
		Digital tools provide a way for businesses to engage their clients in both public (social media posts) and private (closed groups) without necessarily intruding on how the media is consumed by the client or being treated as spam.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

	<p>About the founder Wee Wee- My corporate working experience spans more than 2 decades.  After graduating from National University of Singapore's School of Business, I started as a Management Trainee in DFS, a luxury goods retailer in the duty free space, where I was trained in all aspects of brick and mortar retailing, from being a sales associate, to a sales supervisor, merchandiser, display artist and finally graduating the program to an department operations manager in within DFS Singapore.
	The three years in DFS was a good experience in a tasks associated with running a short, from staffing to ordering stocks, cash availablity and management of the peaks and troughs of a typical sales month.</p>
	<p>A keen interest in analysis and numbers lead me to Nielsen Retail Measurement Services for the next three years, providing Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) clients with the retail insights for the category of products they subscribed from Nielsen.
	These clients included Kimberly Clark and local drink manufacturer Yeo Hiap Seng amongst others.</p>
	<p>The bulk of my work experience was cultivated in a business unit of Deutsche Post DHL, where I joined the DHL Express Singapore country office's marketing department, in charge of research and planning, with product management added progressively and ending in the Asia Pacific regional office of the same Express division.
	In the fifteen years in DHL Express, I have done roles in business development for the South East Asia subregion, headed the sustainability and continuous improvement for the Asia Pacific region and finally as the head of Marketing Communications for the region.
