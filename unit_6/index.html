	<section id="paidsocial">
			<h3>Paid Social</h3>
			<p>What is it? Digital Advertising on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and other social media platforms is available to your business, no matter the size.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Case Study: B2C example</h4>
			<p>An local automotive parallel importer's objectives for online advertising was clear, to bring leads for the showroom car sales team to convert into purchases.</p> 
			<p>Successful sales leads generation is measured by the number of customers and potential customers who eventually purchase a car as a result of the advertisements on social media (Facebook) in this case.</p>
			<p>With a budget of a mere ten dollars a day, after a period of 7 days, two cars (a car in Singapore has a price tag of at least ninety thousand singapore dollars) were sold as a result of the campaign.</p>

			<p>Selection of audience target and timing of advertisements are important. The ability to implement "lookalike" audiences, remarketing to "website custom audiences" is available for all businesses, if your business sets it up correctly at the start of the campaign.</p>

			<h3>Paid Search</h3>
			<p>What is it? Customers turn to online sources to research on products and services before they purchase. Be easily found on Google and other search engines through Search Engine Advertising.
			<br>
			<h4>Case Study: B2C example</h4>
			<p>A local beauty salon buying keywords on Google Adwords to find new customers who would come by for a trial service.</p>
			<p>We have observed across industries that google search adwords tend to cost two to three times more per click versus a facebook ad's cost per click.</p>
			<p>That itself should not be a deterrent for google ad campaigns to increase visitors to your business' website because (potential) customers who search for keywords related to your business are searching to purchase or to collect information before purchase.</p>
			<p>The spend to be invested for google adwords could be calculated as a percentage of potential revenue for successful conversion after X clickthroughs.</p>
			<p>Timing of advertisements, ad copy (ad text) testing and competitive analysis are some keys to success.</p>

			<h3>Go Omni-Channel</h3>
			<p>The push for retail businesses to go online is not new. With the options crowded with e-Marketplaces, how do businesses understand the drivers of costs and levers for profitabilty.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Case Study: B2C example</h4>
			<p>A brick and mortar shoe shop embarks selling online via top-ranked e-marketplaces, selling on facebook and having a dedicated shop website.
			Successfully listed, promoted and sold shop products on Qoo10 (ebay equivalent in South East Asia) and Lazada (Alibaba owned marketplace).</p>
			<p>Created Facebook Business Page to engage existing and would be buyers. Set up products for purchase with Shop function.</p>
			<p>Created online shop for client's product with international delivery option enabled.</p>

			<h3>Business Consulting</h3> 

			<p>Assistance on topics (non-exhaustive):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Engaging existing customers to re-purchase with loyalty rewards and customer referral programs.</li>
				<li>Market Research: Find out what are your competitors doing, formulate and implement a response.</li>
				<li>Customer Contact Strategy: Using digital tools to communicate with your customers from prospects -> to onboarding -> to first purchase -> to repeat.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Marketing basics do not change, the tools used for customer engagement and customer retention provides so many more options for businesses as a result of digital.</p>
			<p>The adage used to be that it costs 5 times more to get a new customer than it is to retain an existing one. Digital tools provide a way for businesses to engage their clients in both public (social media posts) and private (closed groups) without necessarily intruding on how the media is consumed by the client or being treated as spam.</p>
