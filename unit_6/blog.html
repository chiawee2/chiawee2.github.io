<h1>Offline to Online to Offline - creating a virtuous buying cycle for customers<h1>
<p>Disclaimer: I am in no way related to this company Grana, I am simply a customer observing the great experience I had as I was being introduced to this online retailer, and sharing my observations on how e-commerce and online shopping does not change the basics of good marketing, the possibilities around offline to online to offline for retailers.</p>

<h2>Observation 1: The new version of the "Tupperware" party- Unboxing the low-tech way. Online retailers still get a huge leg up from the Offline experiences.<h2>

<p>I have not experienced a "Tupperware" party but I have heard about it, ladies would gather at the seller's house and their friends or aquaintances would buy these really expensive plastic containers because they (a) get to touch and feel the actual items which are normally sold via a catalogue, (b) order products in a soothing cocoon where they know previous users have given their stamp of approval while (c) nibbling on cakes and drinking tea.</p>

<p>Present day- So I had tea with a group of new friends (coincidentally all ladies that day) and one of them had just received her box of Grana items, and she could not resist unboxing her loot (I know I know, it's not unboxing the new iphone but trust me, it's still fun) at the cafe we were at. So I was given an opportunity to feel the Grana items which are made with good quality materials. Conversion of the diehard Uniqlo fan in progress....</p>

Observation 2: The power of referral marketing delivered the "Dark Social" way in an almost Offline mode. 2017 trend alert.</p>

<p>The power of referrals in action. Besides the endorsement of three of the ladies around the table on how great the Grana products were, one of them then proceeded to forward the referral promotional code to all of us via our WhatsApp chat group, telling us that there was a limited holiday season sale on and I was hooked. A simple reward of a 10% discount for me and a 29 SG dollars credit for my friend to shop more was all the encouragement I need. You would notice Grana recommended customers to share their referral codes using Facebook and Twitter - but my friend did exactly what 2017 digital trends point to- that "Dark Social" will gain in prominence in the coming year where private messaging will lead users away from sharing information on social media platforms.</p>

<h2>Observation 3: Online retailers using Offline Pop-up stores to directly connect with their customers, no matter their base location.</h2>

<p>On the Grana website, you will see an item on the menu bar called "Pop Ups".</p>

<p>I am based in Singapore and my friend related how Grana (based in Hong Kong) came to Singapore with a pop-up store at Keong Saik street showcasing their whole range. This allowed their customers to try the sizes of their apparel, and physically feel the items. Such a clever idea! The temporary store reduced the customers' risk of buying an item online which does not fit when it is delivered. This example reminded me of how we all read that brick and mortar businesses in pricey countries like Singapore suffer because online savvy shoppers will go to the stores to try sizes and feel items, leave the store without spending a dollar and buy online from US or UK where the items are cheaper, even after the inclusion of shipping costs.</p>

<p>What Grana did with the pop-up store was deliver an offline experience which encourages the customers to go online afterward. If you are a brick and mortar business suffering because you cannot make a profit after paying rental and hiring retail staff, consider this option. Disrupt thyself before thee gets disrupted.</p>

<h2>Observation 4: The personal touch of a handwritten card and everyone loves their own name. Online shopping followed by an offline "Wow!"</h2>

<p>In this digital age, I marvel at people who continue to sign and send hard copy holiday greeting cards. I advocate going green with digital e-cards which allow more modes of delivery (emails, phone messages), using interactive elements (gifs, videos for storytelling) and ending with a Call-To-Action (asking recipients to "click here" to read about your business' latest news and products for example).</p>

<p>Still, the digital marketing fan that I am, Grana's card in the package blew me away. Firstly, it was handwritten! This card was enclosed in the package I received with my first order. Secondly, they greeted me by my name "Hey Wee Wee" and told me "You Da Best!". Easy win - I felt great the very moment I read the card. The effort in writing that card meant Grana made me feel they really valued my business and the icing on the cake was my new Tshirts came in a free tote bag (blue tote in the photo). I cannot tell you if they do it for all first-time customers or if it was just a Christmas seasonal touch, but I was converted. Bye Uniqlo.</p>

<p>I hope you have enjoyed reading this as much I have enjoyed sharing it- it is interesting how offline to online to offline plays out for e-commerce businesses. And if you quote my referral code while shopping on Grana, it was not the intention of my article (tongue in cheek).</p>
